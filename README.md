Description

This is a React application bootstrapped with Create React App. This project serves as a template to
help you quickly start building a React app. It includes essential development tools and
configurations to get your project up and running.

Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the app running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- Yarn (optional, but recommended for package management)

Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using Yarn or npm.
   
Running the App
1. Start the development server by running the appropriate command.
2. The app will be available at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload automatically whenever
you make changes to the code.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:
yarn start
Runs the app in development mode. You can open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Any changes you make will trigger a page reload. Any lint errors will also be displayed in the
console.
yarn test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details, refer to the React testing
documentation.
yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. This version is optimized for the best performance.
The output files are minified, and filenames will include the hashes. You can then deploy the app to
a production server.
yarn eject


Note: This is a one-way operation! Once you eject, you can't go back. This command removes the
single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and dependencies
(webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. You can modify them as needed, but this gives you
full control over the build process.

You do not need to use this unless you need advanced configuration. The default configuration is
suitable for most use cases.
